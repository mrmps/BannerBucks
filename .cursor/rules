## 🚨 MANDATORY: Always Validate After Code Changes

use Orpc and useQuery. they are there for a reason! Never use useffect.

Always be super typesefe. Never let any lint errors be.

Never use 'any'. Always check for linter errors before completing a task and fix them all.


After making ANY code changes, you MUST run:

```bash
bun run validate
```

This runs BOTH in parallel:
- `turbo lint` - Code style/patterns (Ultracite/Biome)  
- `turbo check-types` - TypeScript type safety

## Why Both Tools Are Required

| Tool | Catches | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Linter** | Style, patterns, best practices | `console.log()`, unused vars, formatting |
| **TypeScript** | Type errors, missing modules | Duplicate packages, type mismatches |

**IMPORTANT:** Linters DO NOT catch type errors. You need both!

## Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Run `bun run validate`
3. Fix any reported errors
4. Repeat until all packages pass

## Quick Commands

```bash
bun run validate    # Lint + type check all packages
bun run lint:fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
bun run lint        # Just lint
bun run check-types # Just type check
```

You should basically never ignore type and lint errors. If you feel the urge, then research best practices on the web.
